# Jupyter Energy

Jupyter Notebooks are a data science tool mostly used for statistics and machine learning, some of the most energy-intensive computing areas.
To increase awareness of energy consumption, this project aims to offer a Jupyter Notebook plugin that informs you of the energy use since the notebook started.

For now, it only contains a Rust program that shows you your current and cumulative energy use, along with some comparisons:

```text
Current energy use: 7.48 joules. Since program start: 457.2 joules. With this energy, you could destroy a piñata. 🪅
```
