# Jupyter Energy

Jupyter Notebooks are a data science tool mostly used for statistics and machine learning, some of the most energy-intensive computing areas.

For now, it only contains a Rust program that shows you your current and cumulative energy use, along with some comparisons:

Current energy use: 7.48 joules.
Since program start: 457.2 joules.
With this energy, you could crack a piÃ±ata. ðŸª…
