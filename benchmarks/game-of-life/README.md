# Conway's Game of Life

This program is from a [GeeksForGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conways-game-life-python-implementation/), but modified so that it doesn't produce a visual output, instead only logging to the console.

It can be executed using `python3 main.py`.

Under the hood, it uses `numpy` for more efficiency compared to standard Python arrays.
