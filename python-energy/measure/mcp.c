// This file defines both a library and a standalone program:

// * To use it as a library, run `gcc --shared -std=gnu99 mcp.c -o mcp.so`. See
//   the `main` function at the bottom of this file for how to use the library.
// * To use it as a program, run `gcc -std=gnu99 mcp.c -o mcp && ./mcp`.
//
// This library is basically a very very stripped down version of the core
// functionality of [Pinpoint](https://github.com/osmhpi/pinpoint) with a very
// slim API on top.
